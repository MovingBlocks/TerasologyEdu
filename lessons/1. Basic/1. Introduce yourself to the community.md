# Introduce yourself to the community!

Terasology's greatest asset is our community - throughout the project's lifetime we've met many great people and look forward to meeting many more! This task will help you get familiarized with Terasology's community by introducing yourself on our IRC channel and community forum.

**Definition of 'Done'**

- Created a thread in the Terasology's forum's Contributor Introductions containing some info about you - name (real or nick), background, interests, related skills, etc
- Posted one small new feature in the intro you would like to see in Terasology or one of our side projects. Identify which of the 5 GCI categories it falls under (code, doc/training, outreach/research, QA, UI)
- Joined Terasology's IRC channel (#terasology on freenode) and shared your idea to learn if something similar exists or is being worked on. May have to wait or try again if a mentor isn't around.

**Where to start?**

Head over here to find the template that can be used for the forum post (copy & paste, edit and submit) - that said, an original introduction is fine and always welcome :)
