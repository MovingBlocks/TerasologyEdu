*This task is designed to be a follow up task to [Make a world generator](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/5718863666741248/)*

Now that you have the terrain we should add something to make it more interesting. This task charges you with adding three features that make your world more interesting. This can be adding new objects like plants and vegetation or it could be more structures like adding rivers, lakes or other water. Whatever your imagination seems fit!

# Definition of 'Done'

 * A pull request made to [AdditionalWorlds](https://github.com/Terasology/AdditionalWorlds) that adds three interesting features to your world generator.
 * A screenshot attached that shows the features you added

# Where to start
* The [World Generation tutorial](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialWorldGeneration/wiki) contains a detailed overview on working with world generation code, as well as a sample world generator - it is the resource you need to use to get started!
* Have a look around the [Terasology Modules](https://github.com/Terasology) to see if there are any interesting things you could include.
* Some good examples include [Poly World](https://github.com/Terasology/PolyWorld), [Caves](https://github.com/Terasology/Caves), [Lakes](https://github.com/Terasology/Lakes) and [ShatteredPlanes](https://github.com/Terasology/ShatteredPlanes)
