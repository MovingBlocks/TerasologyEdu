# Welcome to TerasologyEdu

We at Terasology, through TerasologyEdu, aim to provide open-source education to the masses while also keeping it fun and engaging. TerasologyEdu is build upon the concept of hour-of-code where students can train or polish their skill while using Terasology as a platform.

## How to Use Our Curriculum
Our curriculum is crafted to cater better to younger audiences (kids & teenagers) but it doesn't necessarily means that adults can't enjoy it too. We design our curriculum to introduce concepts of open-source software while also allowing everyone to get the grasp of programming.

Our curriculum are consisted of 4 aspects:
1. Introduction + Open-Source
2. Artwork
3. Documentation
3. World Generation

Students are extremely encouraged to go through the **Introduction + Open-Source** before diving into the other aspects since it's a required fundamental for the other 3 aspects.

We divide aspects into 3 categories based on difficulties:
1. Basic
2. Intermediate
3. Advance

This 3 categories are connected, we extremely suggest you to start from the ***Basic*** curriculum then forward to ***Intermediate*** and then ***Advance***. This will allow the students to fully understand the project and also make sure that they have all the fundamental concepts planted to dive further into the curriculum.
