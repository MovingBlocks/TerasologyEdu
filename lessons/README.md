# Welcome to TerasologyEdu

We at Terasology, through TerasologyEdu, aim to provide open-source education to the masses while also keeping it fun and engaging. TerasologyEdu is built upon the concept of hour-of-code where students can learn or polish their skill while using Terasology as a platform.

## How to Use Our Curriculum
Our curriculum is crafted to cater better to younger audiences (kids & teenagers) but it doesn't necessarily mean that adults can't enjoy it too. We have designed our curriculum to introduce concepts of open-source software while also allowing everyone to get a grasp of programming.

Our curriculum consists of 4 aspects:
1. Introduction + Open-Source
2. Artwork
3. Documentation
3. World Generation

Students are urged to go through the **Introduction + Open-Source** before diving into the other aspects since it is a required pre-requisite for the other three.

We further divide each aspect into 3 categories based on difficulty:
1. Basic
2. Intermediate
3. Advance

These 3 categories are connected and form chains. We recommend to start from the ***Basic*** curriculum then forward to ***Intermediate*** and then to ***Advance***. This will allow the students to fully understand the project and also make sure that they have all the fundamental concepts required to dive further into the curriculum.
