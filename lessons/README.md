## How to Use Our Curriculum
Our curriculum is crafted to cater better to younger audiences (kids & teenagers) but it doesn't necessarily means that adults can't enjoy it too. We design our curriculum to introduce concepts of open-source software while also allowing everyone to get the grasp of programming.

We divide our curriculum into 3 categories:
1. Basic
2. Intermediate
3. Advance

This 3 categories are connected, we extremely suggest you to start from the ***Basic*** curriculum then forward to ***Intermediate*** and then ***Advance***. This will allow the students to fully understand the project and also make sure that they have all the fundamental concepts planted to dive further into the curriculum.
